# Cricket Innings builder

## Main question is : do these top 5 batsman build their innings differently ? 
Question came up as most people I've talked to, and who watch cricket semi-regularly, have noted how Joe Root ends up batting pretty much run a ball however much he scores these days. Kohli always seems to be in superb form and ABDV you can tell if he's going to go big or not. 

What happened to the good old days of getting your eye in for a while, playing super slow in the nervous 90s, and then going all out once you get to your 100?
